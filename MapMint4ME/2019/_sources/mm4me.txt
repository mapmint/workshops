Import
********

By clicking on the Import button from the MapMint4ME application, you
can access the Import module. It is used to create the local copies of
the 3 databses we have presented in introduction
(configuration/dependencies, data to be recorded, and tiles).

As presented in the first screenshot below, the first time you access
the Import there is no MapMint server configured yet. So, you should
click on the *Add Server* button to acces the MapMint server settings,
as shown in the second screenshot below.

In the MapMint server settings, you should define the follwing
parameters:

* **Server Name**: the server name that will appear in the list of available MapMint Server available from the "Import" and "Export" modules,
* **Server URL**: the ZOO-Kernel URL associated with your MapMint Server,
* **Login**: the user name you have defined previously allowing you to access the MapMint client table module online,
* **Password**: the password used to authenticate your user.

In your case you are invited to set ``WS Server`` for the server name
and ``https://demo.mapmint.com/cgi-bin/mm/zoo_loader.cgi`` for the
server URL. Finaly use your personal login and password prior to click
on the *Add server* button below the form.

Then you be redirected to the Import module where your server should
now be listed, click on the Import button to start the production of
the databases on the server side then download it to get it embedded
within the application. Once you have pressed the Import button, you
are first prompted to select the tiles you want to download locally on
your Android device. Then, the process start on the server side and
you are kept informed about the status of the ongoing service from the
importer module. Once the production ends, the download of your local
copy start. You should be able to follow progress of the database
download from the notification bar of your Android device. Once the
download ends, the message "Import success" should appear.

Once data have been successfuly stored locally, you can still access
the elements you have already recorded. This first tool you may use is
the Map module, it lets you visualize every record you have made
(points, lines, and polygon). The second one, is the View module, it
gives you access to the full informations your have recorded and let
you modify one or multiple fields.
