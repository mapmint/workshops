.. _distiller:

The Distiller module
==================

Overview of the interface
*************************

The Distiller Interface contains two pannels and looks like the following.

The Data Stores
***************

A Datastore is containing data sources, it can be local or remote. It is defined by a **unique name** and various parameter depending on its type. By now, there is 4 differents datastore types supported in MapMint: 

.. |adddb| image:: _static/images/add-database.png

========   ================   ====================
**Icon**   **Type**   	      **Action**
--------   ----------------   --------------------
|adddb|    DataBase	         Add a database connection
|adddir|    Directory		    Add a server directory
|addwfs|    WFS Server		       Add a remote WFS server
|addwms|    WMS Server		          Add a remote WMS server
========   ================   ====================


.. warning::
   The datastore name should not contain any **accent** or any special charater available in any language

During this workshop, you will use the two datastore already available: `NC_Raster` and `NC_Shapes`.

.. note::
	Afterward, you can always add your own data in `/var/data/ftp/your-directory` and then create a corresponding datastore from your Distiller.

If you check the checkbox on the left hand side (so in the `Data Stores` section), you will get a list of available datasources in this datastore displayed on the right hand side (so in the `Data Sources` section).

The Data Sources
****************

A data source is corresponding to GIS data available in a datastore (it can be a table in a database, a shapefile in a directory, a layer in WFS/WMS layer). Various datasource types are supported by MapMint.

========== ============================================



Data sources toolbar
--------------------

Once listed, each data source available in a datastore have a toolbar associated which contain the following buttons.

========== ============================================
**Icon**   **Action**       
---------- --------------------------------------------
|spd|      Define access permission
SRS         Define Spatial Reference System
|cds|      Converting the data source
|dds|      Download the data source
|pds|      Preview the data source
|oim|      Open the data store in the manage
|sds|      Delete the data source
|fl|       Display the data source (attributes table or histogram)
========== ============================================

.. warning::
    When the SRS field contain *No EPSG*, it means that MapMint
    understand the SRS of the data source but cannot display it as EPSG
    code, only when *(undefined)* is displayed, the SRS is unknown. In
    such a case, MapMint will use EPSG:4326 definition as default SRS,
    but you can, at any time, click on this button to override this
    definition.

Quickly preview your data
-------------------------

For both vector and raster data source, you can preview your data
source by clicking on the *Preview* button, you will then get a window
presenting the data using a GetMap WMS request and which should look
like the following:
 
============================== ============================================
**Vector data source**	          **Raster data source**       
------------------------------ --------------------------------------------
|pvec|           	  	       |pras|   
============================== ============================================


Vector data sources
*******************

You are invited to first display data sources available in the *NC_Shapes* data store.

Display attributes table
-------------------------------------

If your press the button looking like a down arrow (the last row of
the `toolbar table <#data-sources-toolbar>`__) you can display
the attribute values table and browse your data smoothly, you can
order and modify column order. One important capability of the table
is that you can modify the encoding of your data in case you are using
data not in UTF-8 encoding, this way your data will be returned
correctly in utf-8 from your WFS server.

.. note::
	Vector data source are always using a basic style you cannot
	have access to.

Convert vector data sources
-------------------------------------

You are invited to click on the *Convert* button in the toolbar for
the *poi_names_wake* to acces the converting tool window as presented
in the screenshot bellow.

|ogr2ogr|

The *Vector Converter* window contains various parameters you can set
to create a new data source by transforming the original one. There is
4 part in the form:

 * *Source SRS*: optional, to define the source Spatial Reference System (SRS) (should be onnly used in case  there is written (undefined) in the SRS section in the data source toolbar.
 * *Target*: to define:
    * *Datastore*: the data store where your data source will be created
    * *Datasource name*: the data source name which will be created
    * *SRS*: optional, the SRS used to create the new data source
    * *Format*: the data source format of your created data source
 * *Simplify*: optional, give you the capability to simply the data source geometries
 * *SQL*: optional, give you the capability to simply the data source geometries
 
.. warning::
    in case the created data source is a file, make sure to add the
    extension in its name else it will lead to a directory creation
    making your data store unavailable. So you will have to remove the
    directory created in case you define wrongly the data source
    name. Then, to have up-to-date list, first right click on the Data Store
    unavailable and click on the *Refresh* item from the displayed
    contextual menu, then check it again.

We will use the following example: from the points of interrest data
source, you would like to extract the subset containing only the
*Populated Places*. So you will first check the SQL section and fill
the textarea with the following query:

``SELECT * FROM poi_names_wake WHERE "class" = "Populated Place"``
 
Now, click on the *Run convertion* button, once your data source will
be created, the window should be closed automatically, now you should
refresh your data store, by accessing the contextual menu by right
click on the *NC_Shapes* data store. Once the Distiller was reloaded,
check your data store again and you should see appearing your new data
source.

.. note::
	The Source code of the ZOO-Service vector-converter is based
	on **ogr2ogr** from the `GDAL library <http://gdal.org>`__.

Raster data sources
*******************

You are invited to first display data sources available in the
*NC_Raster* data store.

Display histogram
-------------------------------

If your press the button looking like a down arrow (the last row of
the `toolbar table <#data-sources-toolbar>`__) you can display
the histogram of your rasyer bands.
	
Raster tools
------------

As you did previously for vector data, open the Converter window for
the *elevation* data source.

|gdaldem|

.. |gdaldem| image:: _static/images/gdaldem.png
   :height: 384
   :width: 780
   :alt: Gdaldem window
   
Your goal is to create a new raster data sources named
*elevation_shaded* with a nice shaded relief effect. First select the
hillshade method, then set the *Filename* value to
`test_elevation_shade` then click on the *Run* button.

You are free to generate more raster data sources using other methods,
please make sure to change the name any time you generate a new raster
data source.

Now, you will simply need to refresh you data store as you did
before. Once you have it listed, you can preview it. 

Open a data source in the Manager
*********************************

Using the raster data source created in the previosly, prior to go
to the next section, please click the *Open in the Manager* button 
(6th row from the `toolbar table <#data-sources-toolbar>`__) of the
*elevation_shaded* data source.
  
.. note::
	The raster convertion tools presented here are based on
	gdaldem dan gdal_contour source code from the `GDAL library
	<http://gdal.org>`__.
