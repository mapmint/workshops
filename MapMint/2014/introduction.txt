Introduction
============

A brief overview
***********************

General presentation
---------------------

MapMint is a Geographic Information System (GIS) software running on a
web server made to facilitate the adminstration of a **Spatial Data
Infrastructure** (SDI), publishing cartographic portals and dynamic
applications.

The MapMint platform is a GIS Software accessible thourgh a simple web
browser but also a modular and extensible WEB-GIS application
generator. It provides numerous GIS capability and let the user do
the following:


 * **Import and store GIS data** (both vector and raster data)
 * **Query Relational Database System** and external WMS/WFS servers 
 * **Publish GIS data** by using OGC Web Services: WMS, WFS et WMTS
 * **Treate, edit and style** data sources
 * Compose and save maps to create application projects (using mapfile)
 * Configure and generate Web GIS applications
 * **Configure** and use GIS portals
 * **Access** and share maps

Basic concepts: using the OGC standards
---------------------------------------

The main idea behind the MapMint solution is the massive usage of OGC
Web Services and making all processing in the solution available as
WPS services using the ZOO-Project OpenSource software.

Main software components
-------------------------------

MapMint is using numerous OSGeo softwares and bring them all together
in a complete Web-GIS platform by using the WPS to make them
understandable and usable to and from each other.


============   =====
**Software**   **Usage**
------------   -----
|zoo|               All the processing in the MapMint solution iso based on the ZOO-Project so on the OGC WPS standard, even to produce dynamic web pages.
|ms|                MapMint use the MapServer cartographic engine to publish your date through OGC Web Services (WMS,WFS and WCS) in an efficient way.
|gd|                 The abstraction library used to access and interract with datasources transparently is the GDAL/OGR library.
|ol|                  MapMint User Interfaces (UI) are using OpenLayers.

The workshop content
***********************
    
In this sections you will find general information about what will be done
during this workshop and what are the main objetives, the geographic
data used are also introduced.

Workshop schedule
---------------------------------

You are invited to use the computer available in the room and keep
plugged the MapMint USB Stick provided.

The workshop is organized in 4 sections:

* a presentation of MapMint and how it works
* use case example of the module to administrate your GIS data by using an available dataset
* an example of map production and spreading of the data as WMS and WFS
* a presentation on how to publish an application using map created previously

.. note::

	Please, do not hesitate, at any time, to ask the presenters any question you may have during the workshop.

Using the MapMint USB Stick
-------------------------------------

============================== ============================================
|usb|                          
                               The MapMint solution is available on an
			       iso image made available on the USB
			       stick provided. This iso image is a
			       simple adaptation of the official `OSGeoLive 7.9
			       <http://live.osgeo.org>`__
============================== ============================================

.. note::

	The USB 3.0 Stick is provided for use during the workshop and
	should be given back at the end. You can buy one USB Stick
	including the SDI for only **12€** (the usb stick price + some
	taxes...).
	
To use the USB stick, please first plug it to your computer and start
the VirtualBox program if it is not already running.

Create a new virtual machine **without any disk**, choose "Linux" and
"Ubuntu" as operating system.

Now, access configuration  of your virtual machine to define the iso
image available on the USB stick as CD drive.

Close the configuration pannel then boot your brand new virtual
machine. You should see grub prompt, you are invited to press
``Enter`` to make your VM boot, then, after few seconds, you should
have access to the desktop environment as presented in the following.

**Welcome in MapMint Live !**

During this workshop, the geographic dataset used is coming from `Edu Data Package North
Carolina <http://www.grassbook.org/data_menu3rd.php>`__, provided by
contributors of the `GRASS GIS <http://grass.osgeo.org/>`__ project
and available per default in OSGeoLive.

Using MapMint
****************
    
MaMint is made of an **administration interface** (*MapMint Admin*)
composed of various modules and a **public interface** (*MapMint
Client*) containing published maps.

You can access directly to both interfaces by using corresponding
links on your desktop.

============================================ ============================================
*MapMint Admin*                              *MapMint Client*

.. note::

	During this workshop, you are invited to open MapMint Admin
	and MapClient in two different tab in yoru browser for being
	able to quickly switch from one to the other.
	
MapMint Admin
---------------------------------

For accessing the administration interface, first click on the desktop
link named **MapMint Admin** then fill the **login** and **password**
provided in the following, then press the login button.

.. note::

	* login: **test**
	* password: **demo02**

.. |login| image:: ../../_static/images/login-screen.png
   :width: 780

|login|

.. note::
	You can also simply press *Enter* rather than using the Login button.
	
A success message should be displayed on top of your interface then
the Dashboard module should load. In case you have a red banner on top
rather than the expected green one, then please verify informations
you filled.

Despite more modules are vailable in MapMint and can be activated by
using specific parameter, for this workshop, the following modules are available in the
administration interface. You can access them by using links on top of
the interface, once logued in MapMint Admin.
 
==========   ===
**Module**          **URL**
----------   ---
Dashboard           http://localhost/mapmint/ui/Dashboard
Distiller           http://localhost/mapmint/ui/Distiller
Themes           http://localhost/mapmint/ui/Themes
Manager           http://localhost/mapmint/ui/Manager
Publisher           http://localhost/mapmint/ui/Publisher
==========   ===

Accessing the public interface
-------------------------------------

The MapMint public interface can be accessed by using the following link
http:localhost/mapmint/ui/public/. Each published map is accessible
from the maps listing page or can be directly accessed by using a
specific URL (such as http://localhost/mapmint/ui/public/your-map-name).

==============================   ============================================
**Module**                       **URL**
