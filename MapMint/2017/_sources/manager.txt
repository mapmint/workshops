The *Data Layers* panel
************************

The *Data Layers* panel is the left-side panel and contains two elements:
 * A map gesture toolbar
 * A tree presenting your layers list
 
.. note::
	For each MapMint map there is a configuration file which is a
	MapServer mapfile
   
Open a Map
----------

To open an existing map, simply click on the button presented below
and the *Open Map* window presented below to let you choose one
amongst the listed ones.

From this window, if you click on the *Open* button, your Manager will
be reloaded using the choosen map.

Save a map
----------

To save your current map, you should click on the *Save* button in the toolbar.
You can use the text field to save your map using a different name.

|savema|

.. warning::
   The map name should not contain any space, accent or any special character.

You are now invited to name your map *Sample1*, then save it. Your
Manager module will be reloaded and it will display the map name as set by you.



.. warning::
   Each time you open a map using the *Open in Manager* button as
   you did previously, the first step is to save your map with a
   correct name. The *Untitled_0* is the default temporary name given
   each time an adminstrator is opening a layer in the Manager from
   the Distiller module.
   
Layers tree
-----------

Just on top of your layers tree, you have access to the specific
layers toolbar which gives you access to the following options.

Add Layers
**********

By pressing the button *Add Layer*, you have then a window like the
one presented below which lets you choose the data store first, then
the list of layers available in it and finally, the place in the tree
where you want your layer to be added.

|oim|

.. note::
   If a layer is added directly at the root level, so as a child of
   the root node (*Layers*), then it won't be available in the layer
   switcher in the corresponding published web application.
	
Your objective is to add the *elevation* data source you used to
create *elevation_shaded*. So, you will first select the *NC_Raster*,
then the data sources listed will be refreshed and then you can select
the *elevation* data source to add it as a new layer to your current
map.

Now, you are invited to do the same procedure to add the following
layers from the *NC_Shapes* data store:

 * lakes
 * roadsmajor
 * new_poi_wake

.. note::
	You can use *Ctrl* + click to select multiple data sources to
	add them as individual layers to your current map.

.. warning::
   If you keep the default value for the Group where your layer will
   be located, it will signify that this layer won't be available in the
   layer switcher in the published application.

Defining Layer Styles
*********************

In this section, you will learn how to define the style used to display
your data in the final application. 

.. note::
   All modifications made to the layer style is automatically saved in
   the map configuration file, so there is no need for pressing the
   *Save* button in the *Data Layers* toolbar.


Basic raster style
------------------

You are invited to right click on the *elevation_hillshade* layer and after that on the *Style* item to have a window giving you access to the
basic settings for raster data:
 * *Resampling method*
 * *Opacity*
 * *Legend Type*

You should set resampling method to *AVERAGE*, opacity to 75% and keep
the default value for *Legend Type* (*GreyScale*), then press the
*Apply* button at the bottom of the form.

|bsv|

Classify raster layer
-----------------------------

You are now invited to edit the style of the *elevation* layer of your
map. Do as you did `before <#basic-raster-style>`__, but set opacity
to 50%.

Once you pressed the *Apply* button, you can now set the *Legend
Type* value to *Graduated Symbol*, you will automatically see the form
updated consequently as presented in the screenshot below.

|rasc|

From this form, you can set minimum and maximum value to classify,
define min and max color used to generate colors, the band used to
classify and finally the number of classes. 

By now, let's start by choosing a minimum and maximum color, set
number of classes to 25, then press *Classify*, you should have
similar result as the one above.

.. |rasc| image:: _static/images/rasc.png

   :width: 780
   :alt: Classify raster

Basic vector style
------------------

You will start by editing the style of the *lakes* layer. First of all, you should check the *Pattern* panel and set its value to *4.0 3.0*, then
press the *Apply* button. Now, check also the *Hatch fill* panel and
set the following values:
 * *Angle*: 45.0
 * *Size*: 6.0
 * *Dash Width*: 4.0

Click on the *Apply* button and you should have the same result as
displayed below.

|emap0|


Classify a vector layer
---------------------------------

In this section you will create classes based on
classification. Classifications presented in this section are using
*R*, you will use the *poi_name_wake* layer to test this style
definition.

Set the *Legend Type* to *Graduated Symbol*, choose min and max
colors, choose the *elev_m* field to classify your data, set number of
generated classes to 30 and set the discretisation method to
*quantile*, then press the *Classify* button to have similar result as
presented below.

|emap1|

.. |vecc| image:: _static/images/vecc.png

Before closing this section about Styling, you are invited to apply a
style to  your *roadsmajor* layer.

Layers properties
***********************************

Metadata
---------------------------------

For each layer in your map, you are invited to define metadata, for
now, you will concentrate on giving a *title* to your layer, then press
the *Save* button.

.. warning::

	Titles will be displayed in the layer tree of the published
	application only.
	
You can also define basic OWS Metadata informations for your layers,
such as *abstract*, *keywords* and *fees*. other options will be
presented in the next sections.

The metadata can be accessed through a simple WMS *GetCapabilities*
request sent to the MapServer engine, like the following:

``http://localhost/cgi-bin/mapserv.cgi?map=/var/data/maps/Project_Sample1.map&service=WMS&version=1.0.0&request=GetCapabilities`` 
	
Queryable layers
---------------------------------

You would like to make the final application available to user with an ability to display
information in a popup when they move their mouse on top of a feature.
To achieve this goal, you first have to declare in the layer'
properties window that you want your *poi_names_wake* queryable by
checking the *Query* option. Then you should also create a template to
display attributes in the popup, as explained in the next step.

You are also invited to check the *Search* option and select the
*featurename* field as field to run the research. This way you can
activate more tools at the next step.

Every time you make a modification to the *Layer Properties* window
you should press the *Save* button for your modification to take effect.

You are also willing to publish a web application with a tool to draw
line and extract the corresponding elevation profile based on a
specific raster. To do that, you should activate the *Query* option to
the *elevation* layer.

|vecp|

Configure popup window
-----------------------------------

You are now invited to use the template editor for the
*new_poi_names_wake* layer of your map. You can select fields you want
to diaplay by selecting value in the *Available fields*, you can
easily control the way it will be displayed by using WYSIWYG
editor. Click on the *Save* button to save your template.
 
|cpop|

.. |cpop| image:: _static/images/cprop.png

.. note::

	If you need to, you can always edit pure HTML code by clicking
	on the *Source* button of the editor.
