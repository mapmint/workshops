Introduction
============

A brief overview
***********************

General presentation
---------------------

MapMint is a Geographic Information System (GIS) software running on a
web server. It is made to facilitate the administration of a **Spatial Data
Infrastructure** (SDI), publishing cartographic portals and dynamic
applications.

The MapMint platform is not only a GIS Software accessible through a simple web
browser but also a modular and extensible WEB-GIS application
generator. It provides numerous GIS capabilities and lets the user accomplish
the following tasks:


 * **Import and store GIS data** (both vector and raster data)
 * **Query Relational Database System** and external WMS/WFS servers 
 * **Publish GIS data** by using OGC Web Services: WMS, WFS et WMTS
 * **Create, edit and style** data sources
 * Compose and save maps to create application projects (using mapfile)
 * Configure and generate Web GIS applications
 * **Configure** and use GIS portals
 * **Access** and share maps

Basic concepts: using the OGC standards
---------------------------------------

The main idea behind the MapMint solution is the massive usage of OGC
Web Services and making all processing in the solution available as
WPS services, using the ZOO-Project OpenSource software.

Main software components
-------------------------------

MapMint is using numerous OSGeo software and brings them all together
in a complete and integrated Web-GIS platform by using the WPS to make them
understandable and usable from each other.


============   =====
**Software**   **Usage**
------------   -----
|zoo|               All the processing in the MapMint solution is based on the ZOO-Project and on the OGC WPS standard, even to produce dynamic web pages.
|ms|                MapMint use the MapServer cartographic engine to publish the data through OGC Web Services (WMS,WFS and WCS) in an efficient way.
|gd|                 The abstraction library used to access and interact with datasources transparently is the GDAL/OGR library.
|ol|                  MapMint User Interfaces (UI) are using OpenLayers.

The workshop content
***********************
    
In the upcoming sections, you will find general information about what will be done
during this workshop and what are the main objectives. The geographic
data used is also introduced briefly.

Workshop schedule
---------------------------------

During this workshop, you will use Docker and Docker Compose to
quickly setup MapMint locally on your computer.

The workshop is organized in 4 sections:

* A presentation on how to install MapMint using Docker Compose
* Use case example of the module to administrate your GIS data by using an available services
* An example of map production and spreading of the data as WMS and WFS
* A presentation on how to publish an application using map created previously

.. note::

	Please, at any time, do not hesitate to ask the presenters any question you have during the workshop.


Geographic dataset
-------------------------------------

During this workshop, the geographic dataset used is coming from `Edu Data Package North
Carolina <http://www.grassbook.org/data_menu3rd.php>`__, provided by
contributors of the `GRASS GIS <http://grass.osgeo.org/>`__ project
and available by default in OSGeoLive.

Data are subject to `Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike
(CC-BY-SA) <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/>`__. More
information on this dataset are available on this `page
<http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Edu_Data_Package_North_Carolina>`__ .

Installing MapMint using Docker Compose
********************************************

For being able to install MapMint using `Docker
Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>`__, you will need
to download the source code of both, the ZOO-Project and MapMint
GitHub repositories. You can find below the commands to setup a
working startup tree. 

.. code-block:: guess

    git clone https://github.com/ZOO-Project/ZOO-Project.git
    cd ZOO-Project
    git clone https://github.com/mapmint/mapmint
    cp mapmint/docker-compose.yml .

You should also create a minimal set of directories / files required
by MapMint to run.

.. code-block:: guess

    mkdir data data/share data/dirs data/maps data/public_maps tmp \
    	  tmp/descriptions tmp/cache
    touch \
    	  tmp/MainDescriptionMM5f6ee5fe-0b04-11ec-97ff-0242c0a8e006.html
    cp mapmint/template/data/maps/* data/maps/

Then, you should download the sample dataset archive and uncompress.

.. code-block:: guess

    curl -o north_carolina.tar.bz2 \
      http://geolabs.fr/dl/north_carolina.tar.bz2
    tar -xvf north_carolina.tar.bz2 -C data/share/

To start the MapMint Docker Compose environment, you simply use the
following command:


.. code-block:: guess

    docker-compose up

Now, you are ready to use your MapMint instance.

**Welcome to MapMint!**

Using MapMint
****************
    
MaMint is made of an **administration interface** (*MapMint Admin*)
composed of various modules and a **public interface** (*MapMint
Client*) containing published maps.

============================================ ============================================
*MapMint Admin*                              *MapMint Client*

MapMint Admin
---------------------------------

For accessing the administration interface, first use this link
`MapMint Admin <http://localhost/ui/Dashboard_bs>`__ then fill the
**login** and **password** provided below and press the
login button. 

.. note::

	* login: **test**
	* password: **demo02**

   :align: center
   
.. note::
	You can also simply press *Enter* rather than using the Login button.
	
A success message should be displayed on top of your interface and the Dashboard module will load. In case you see a red banner on top
rather than the expected green one, then please re-check the credentials and information entered by you.

Despite more modules are available in MapMint and can be activated by
using specific parameter, for this workshop, the following modules are available in the
administration interface. You can access them by using links on top of
the interface, once logged in MapMint Admin.
 
==========   ===
**Module**          **URL**
----------   ---
Dashboard           http://localhost/ui/Dashboard_bs
Distiller           http://localhost/ui/Distiller_bs
Themes              http://localhost/ui/Themes_bs
Manager             http://localhost/ui/Manager_bs
Publisher           http://localhost/ui/Publisher_bs
==========   ===

Accessing the public interface
-------------------------------------

The MapMint public interface can be accessed by using the following link
http:localhost/ui/public/. Each published map is accessible
from the maps listing page or can be directly accessed by using a
specific URL (such as http://localhost/ui/public/your-map-name).

==============================   ============================================
**Module**                       **URL**       
------------------------------   --------------------------------------------
Public Interface                  http://localhost/ui/public/
Published Map                     http://localhost/ui/public/your-map-name
